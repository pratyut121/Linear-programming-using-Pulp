# Linear-programming-using-Pulp
A mathematical optimization model consists of an objective function and a set of constraints in the form of a system of equations or inequalities.
Linear and integer programming are key techniques for discrete optimization problems and they pop up pretty much everywhere in modern business and technology sectors. We will discuss how to tackle such problems using Python library PuLP and get a fast and robust solution.
